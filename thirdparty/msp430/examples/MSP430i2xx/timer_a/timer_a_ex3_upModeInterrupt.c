 * MSP430i2xx Timer_A - Up Mode Interrupt
 *
 * Description: In this example, the 16 bit Timer_A is configured in up mode and
 * setup to interrupt once the timer hits the value defined by the user. The
 * timer uses SMCLK divided down to 256kHz as its clock source. This example is
 * useful if you are trying to perform a periodic task, and can easily be
 * adapted by changing the timer period and clock dividers. Once the timer is
 * equal to the value in CCR0 an interrupt occurs signaling that the desired
 * time has past. CCR0 does not share an interrupt vector so all interrupt flag
 * checking and clearing is performed by hardware. In the given example the
 * LED should toggle every 250ms. The period calculation can be seen below.
