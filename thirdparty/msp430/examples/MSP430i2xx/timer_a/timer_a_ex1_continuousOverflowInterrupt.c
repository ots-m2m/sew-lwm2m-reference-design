 * MSP430i2xx Timer_A - Continuous Mode Overflow Interrupt
 *
 * Description: In this example, the 16 bit Timer is configured in continuous
 * mode and setup to interrupt on an overflow. The timer uses ACLK as its
 * source running at 32kHz. Therefore 2^16 counts at 32kHz will take ~2.048
 * seconds to overflow. The LED show toggle at a period of ~4.096 seconds.
