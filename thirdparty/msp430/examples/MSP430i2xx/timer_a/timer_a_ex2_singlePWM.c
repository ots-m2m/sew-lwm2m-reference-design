 * MSP430i2xx Timer_A - Single PWM
 *
 * Description: In this example, the 16 bit Timer_A is configured to output a
 * 75% duty cycle PWM on P1.5. The timer uses SMCLK / 4 for a clock source and
 * outputs a PWM signal with a 8ms period. The PWM generation does not require
 * any interrupts and stays in LPM0. Calculations for the period and duty
 * cycle can be seen below.
