 * MSP430i20xx Flash - Flash In-System Programming, Information Segment
 *
 * Description: Unlock the Information Segment, overwrite a number of values
 * within it, then re-lock the Information Segment when writes are complete.
 * Set breakpoint on NOP in main loop to avoid stressing flash. DO NOT ERASE
 * ENTIRE INFORMATION SEGMENT, important values (TLV, etc) are contained
 * within this segment.
