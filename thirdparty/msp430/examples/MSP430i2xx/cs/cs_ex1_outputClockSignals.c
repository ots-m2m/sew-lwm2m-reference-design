 * MSP430i2xx Clock System - Output Clock Signals
 *
 * Description: In this example, the DCO is setup to use the internal resistor.
 * Then the GPIO pins are configured in peripheral function mode so that the
 * clock signals are output on the pins. Finally, clock dividers are set for
 * the MCLK and SMCLK to show a divided clock. The divided clocks can be seen
 * on the pins using an measurement device. This example demonstrates how to
 * setup the DCO and setup the clock speed for the device.
