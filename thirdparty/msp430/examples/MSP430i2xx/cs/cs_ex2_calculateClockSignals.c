 * MSP430i2xx Clock System - Calculate Clock Signals
 *
 * Description: In this example, the clock signals are setup as dividers of DCO.
 * MCLK is setup as DCO / 4 = 4.096 MHz and SMCLK is setup as
 * DCO / 8 = 2.048 MHz. ACLK is 32kHz when using the internal resistor for DCO.
 * After setting up the clock signals, APIs are called to ensure that the
 * correct speed was set correctly. The speed is calculated using the register
 * settings.
