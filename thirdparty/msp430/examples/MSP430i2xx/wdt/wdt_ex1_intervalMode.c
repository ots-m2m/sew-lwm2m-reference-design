 * MSP430i2xx Watchdog Timer - Interval Mode
 *
 * Description: In this example, the Watchdog Timer is setup in interval with
 * ACLK as a source. The WDT divides ACLK by 32768 so that it interrupts in
 * 1s intervals. The LED is toggled in the WDT ISR to show that the ISR
 * has been reached.
