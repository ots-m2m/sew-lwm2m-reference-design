 * MSP430i2xx Watchdog Timer - Watchdog Mode
 *
 * Description: In this example, the Watchdog Timer is setup in watchdog mode
 * using SMCLK as a source. SMCLK is configured as the DCO / 16 and the WDT
 * is configured as SMCLK / 32768 resulting in a Watchdog period of 32ms. The
 * LED is turned on when entering LPM and turned off once the device has been
 * reset by the WDT. After reset the device checks to make sure it was the
 * WDT that caused the interrupt and turns off the LED.
