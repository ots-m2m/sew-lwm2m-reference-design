 * MSP430i2xx TLV - Check Checksum
 *
 * Description: In this example, the checksum of the TLV is checked to make sure
 * the TLV has not been corrupted. The LED is turned on if there are no errors
 * with the TLV. To cause an error, backup the TLV first and then erase part of
 * it. This will cause a checksum error to occur and the LED will not turn on.
