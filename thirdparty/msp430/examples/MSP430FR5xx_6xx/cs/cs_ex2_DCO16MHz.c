//   MSP430FR59xx Demo - Configure MCLK for 16MHz operation
//
//   Description: Configure SMCLK = MCLK = 16MHz
//   IMPORTANT NOTE: While the FRxxx is capable of operation w/ MCLK = 16MHz
//   the throughput of the device is dependent on accesses to FRAM.
//   The maximum speed for accessing FRAM is limited to 8MHz*.
//   Wait states are inserted when the FRAM is accessed at
//   speeds higher than 8MHz to prevent timing violations.
//   Refer to the FRCTL chapter of the User's Guide.
//   * Refer device D/s for typical numbers
