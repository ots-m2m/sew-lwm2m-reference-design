//! WDT - Toggle P1.0, Interval Overflow ISR, DCO SMCLK
//!
//!  Toggle P1.0 using software timed by the WDT ISR. Toggle rate is approx.
//!  30ms = {(default DCO 1.045MHz) / 32768} based on default DCO = SMCLK clock
//!  source used in this example for the WDT.
//!  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO ~1.045MHz
//!
//!  Tested On: MSP430FR5969

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - WDT peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - WDT_A_VECTOR
