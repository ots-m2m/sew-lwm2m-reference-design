//! MPY - 16x16 Signed Multiply Accumulate
//!
//!  Hardware multiplier is used to multiply two numbers. The calculation is
//!  automatically initiated after the second operand is loaded.  A second
//!  multiply-accumulate operation is performed after that. Results are stored
//!  in RESLO and RESHI.  SUMEXT contains the extended sign of the result.
//!
//!  ACLK = 32.768kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
//!
//!  Tested On: MSP430F5438A,MSP430FR5739,MSP430FR5969,MSP430FR2433
