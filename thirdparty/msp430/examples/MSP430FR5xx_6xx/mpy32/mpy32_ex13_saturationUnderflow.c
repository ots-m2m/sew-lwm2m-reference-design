//! MPY - Saturation Mpode Underflow Test
//!
//!  Description: The example illustrates a special case showing underflow.
//!  Underflow occurs when adding 2 negative numbers yields a positive result.
//!  By having the saturation mode enabled, the result if rounded off to the
//!  highest negative number (0x8000.0000 for 16 bit). Results can be viewed
//!  in the debugger window.
//!
//!  ACLK = 32.768kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
//!
//!  Tested On: MSP430F5438A,MSP430FR5739,MSP430FR5969,MSP430FR2433
