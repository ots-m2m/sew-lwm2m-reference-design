//! CRC - Calculate CRC and check result

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - CRC peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
