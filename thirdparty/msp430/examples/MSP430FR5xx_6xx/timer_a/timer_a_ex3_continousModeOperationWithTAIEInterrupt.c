//! TIMER_A, Toggle P1.0, Overflow ISR, 32kHz ACLK
//!
//! Description: Toggle P1.0 using software and the TIMER_A overflow ISR.
//! In this example an ISR triggers when TB overflows. Inside the ISR P1.0
//! is toggled. Toggle rate is exactly 0.25Hz = [32kHz/FFFFh]/2. Proper use of the
//! TAIV interrupt vector generator is demonstrated.
//! ACLK = TBCLK = 32kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO ~ 1.045MHz
//!
//! Tested On: MSP430FR5969
//!         ---------------
//!     /|\|               |

//!        |           P1.0|-->LED
//!
//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - Timer peripheral
//! - GPIO peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - TIMER_A7
