//! CRC - Build Signature and Rebuild to test.
//!
//!  The CRC is first used to build a signature using a seed and multiple data
//!  values. This signature is considered as the checksum and can be sent by a
//!  UART connection along with the data to verify the correct data has been
//!  sent. The second half of this program is used to test the CRC checksum of
//!  the data that has been created, by recreating the same checksum and
//!  comparing it to the first checksum. If the two checksum are equal, then
//!  P1.0 is set and the LED is turned on. Breakpoints can be set before the
//!  CRC_setData() function to observe the CRC register values and see the
//!  subsequent signatures before/after each data set.
//!
//!  Tested On: MSP430F5529,MSP430FR5739
//!             -----------------
//!         /|\|                 |

//!
//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - CRC peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - NONE
