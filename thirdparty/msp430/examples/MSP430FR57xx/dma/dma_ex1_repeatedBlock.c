//! DMA - Repeated Block Transfer to-and-from RAM, Software Trigger.
//!
//!  A 16 word block from 1C00-1C1Fh is transfered to 1C20h-1C3fh using DMA0 in
//!  a burst block using software DMAREQ trigger. After each transfer, source,
//!  destination and DMA size are reset to initial software setting because DMA
//!  transfer mode 5 is used. P1.0 is toggled during DMA transfer only for
//!  demonstration purposes.
//!  ** RAM location 0x1C00 - 0x1C3F used - make sure no compiler conflict **
//!  ACLK = REFO = 32kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO 1048576Hz
//!
//!   Tested on MSP430F5529, MSP430FR5739

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - DMA peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - None.
