//!Toggle P2.4 using hardware TA1.0 output. Timer1_A is configured
//!for up/down mode with CCR0 defining period, TA1.0 also output on P2.4. In
//!this example, CCR0 is loaded with 250 and TA1.0 will toggle P2.4 at
//!TACLK/2*250. Thus the output frequency on P2.4 will be the TACLK/1000.
//!No CPU or software resources required.
//!As coded with TACLK = SMCLK, P2.4 output frequency is ~1.045M/1000.
//!SMCLK = MCLK = TACLK = default DCO ~1.045MHz
//!
//!Tested On: MSP430FR5739

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - Timer peripheral
//! - GPIO peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
