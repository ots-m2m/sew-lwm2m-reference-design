//  MSP430FR57xx PMM Test
// This example shows transitions between a user Reset via the reset button, a
// software triggered BOR, a previous LPMx.5 state indicator flag, and entrance
// into LPM4.5. Reading the reset interrupt flag from PMMIFG register is equivalent
// to reading from reset vector register.
//
// Upon device power on you will see the following sequence of LED's
// X = off
// O = on
//
// _7 = On indicates BOR
// _6 = On indicates Reset (from user button)
// _5 = on indicates device was previously in LPMx.5 state before the reset
// _4 = On indicates device is NOT sleeping.  Off means device is in LPM4.5
//*******************************************************************************
//
//  1) Power on device:
//      X7 X6 X5 O4             LED4 is on, device is running and was not in LPM4.5 mode previously.
//
//  2) Press User Reset button:
//
//      X7 O6 X5 O4				Device is running and has reset due to RST pin
//      O7 X6 X5 O4				Device is running and has reset due to a software BOR
//      X7 X6 X5 X4				Device is now in LPM4.5
//
//  3) Press User Reset button:
//      X7 X6 O5 O4				Device is running and was previously in LPM4.5
//
//	4) Press User Reset button:
//		Device will restart the sequence beginning at step 2).
