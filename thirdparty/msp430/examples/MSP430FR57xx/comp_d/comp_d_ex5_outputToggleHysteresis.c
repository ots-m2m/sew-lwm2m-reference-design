//  MSP430FR57xx Demo - COMPD Hysteresis, CDOUT Toggle in LPM4; High speed mode
//
//  Description: Use Compd and shared reference to determine if input 'Vcompare'
//  is high of low.  Shared reference is configured to generate hysteresis.
//  When Vcompare exceeds Vcc*3/4 CDOUT goes high and when Vcompare is less
//  than Vcc*1/4 then CDOUT goes low.
//  P3.5/CDOUT is connected internally to an LED; it will toggle accordingly.
