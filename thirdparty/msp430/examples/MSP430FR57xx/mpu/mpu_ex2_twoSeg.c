//!  MSP430FR57x Demo - MPU Write protection violation - PUC
//!
//!  Description: The MPU segment boundaries are defined by:
//!  Border 1 = 0xD000 [segment #: 8]
//!  Segment 1 = 0xC200 - 0xCFFF
//!  Segment 2 = 0xD000 - 0xFFFF
//!  Segment 2 is write protected. Any write to an address in the segment 2 range
//!  causes a PUC. The LEDs toggles due to repeated PUCs. A delay is included
//!  so the debugger can gain access via JTAG.
//!
//!  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = TACLK = default DCO = ~625 KHz
//!
//!           MSP430FR5739
