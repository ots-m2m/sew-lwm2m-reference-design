//*****************************************************************************
//! This example shows how to configure the I2C module as a master for
//! single byte reception in interrupt driven mode. The address of the slave
//! module that the master is communicating with also set in this example.
//!
//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - I2C peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral (for I2C pins)
//! - SCL2
//! - SDA
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - USCI_B0_VECTOR.
//!
//
//*****************************************************************************
//*****************************************************************************
//
//Set the address for slave module. This is a 7-bit address sent in the
//following format:
//[A6:A5:A4:A3:A2:A1:A0:RS]
//
//A zero in the "RS" position of the first byte means that the master
//transmits (sends) data to the selected slave, and a one in this position
//means that the master receives data from the slave.
