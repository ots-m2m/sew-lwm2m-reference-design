//!  AES Encryption and Decryption Example
//!
//!  Description: This demo shows how to use the AES Encryption and Decryption
//!
//!               CC430F5137
//!             -----------------

//!	Key: 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f
//!	Plaintext: 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff
//!	Ciphertext: 69c4e0d86a7b0430d8cdb78070b4c55a
//!
//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - WDT peripheral
//! - AES
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - None.
