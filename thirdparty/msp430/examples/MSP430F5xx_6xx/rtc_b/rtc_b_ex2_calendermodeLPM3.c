//! RTC_B in Calendar mode with LPM3, Interruptions every 1s, 1m, and 5th day of
//!     week at 5:00pm
//!
//!  This program demonstrates the RTC mode by triggering an interrupt every
//!  second and minute. This code toggles P1.0 every second. This code
//!  recommends an external LFXT1 crystal for RTC accuracy.
//!  Note that if XT1 is not present the code loops in an infinite loop.
//!  ACLK = LFXT1 = 32768Hz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO = 32 x ACLK = 1048576Hz
//!
//!  Tested On: MSP430F6638
//!             -----------------
//!        /|\ |              XIN|-

//!            |                 |
//!
//!
//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - RTC peripheral
//! - UCS peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//! - Battery Backup peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - RTC_B_VECTOR
