//! ADC10_A - Sample A2-0 Inputs directly to DMA, 8-Bit Res, Single Seq.
//!
//!  MSP430F550x Demo
//!  Sample A2/A1/A0 as single sequence with reference to AVcc. Software sets
//!  ADC10SC to trigger sample sequence. In Mainloop MSP430 waits in LPM0 to
//!  save power until ADC10_A conversion complete, DMA_ISR will force exit from
//!  any LPMx. ADC10_A internal oscillator times sample period (16x) and
//!  conversion (13x). DMA transfers conv results ADC_Result variable.
//!  Notice that the conversions go in the order of A2, A1, then A0.

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must

//! - DMA peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//! - A2
//! - A1
//! - A0
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example

//! vector table.
