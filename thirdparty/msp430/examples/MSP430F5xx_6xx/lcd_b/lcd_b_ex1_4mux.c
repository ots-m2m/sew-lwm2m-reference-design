//! LCD_B, 4-Mux example, display a string "430" on FH-1138P LCD.
//! This examples shows how to config LCD_B in 4-Mux mode with DriverLib
//! functions on the MSP430FG6626 target board (connected with FH-1138P LCD). The
//! internal voltage is sourced to v2 through v4 and v5 is connected to ground.
//! Charge pump is enabled and one 4.7uF capacitor is required to connected from
//! pin LCDCAP to ground.
//!
//! It uses LCD pin S0~S11 as segment pins.
//! f(LCD) = 32768Hz/((1+1)*2^4) = 1024Hz, ACLK = ~32768Hz,
//! MCLK = SMCLK = default DCODIV ~1MHz.
