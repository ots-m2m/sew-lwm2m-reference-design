//! ADC12_A - Sample A0 Input, External Ref
//!  MSP430F552x Demo
//!
//!  This example shows how to use an external positive reference for the ADC12_A.
//!  The external reference is applied to the VeREF+ pin. AVss is used for the
//!  negative reference. A single conversion is performed on channel A0. The
//!  conversion results are stored in ADC12MEM0 and Test by applying a voltage
//!  to channel A0, then setting and running to a break point at the "_NOP()"
//!  instruction. To view the conversion results, open an SFR window in debugger
//!  and view the contents of ADC12MEM0.
//!
//!  NOTE: VeREF+ range: 1.4V (min) to AVCC (max)
//!        VeREF- range: 0V (min) to 1.2V (max)
//!        Differential ref voltage range: 1.4V(min) to AVCC(max)
//!			(see datasheet for device specific information)
