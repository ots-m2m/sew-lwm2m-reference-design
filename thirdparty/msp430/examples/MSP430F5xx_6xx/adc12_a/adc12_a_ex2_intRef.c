//! ADC12_A - Sample A0 Input, 1.5V Internal Ref
//!  MSP430F552x Demo
//!
//!  This example shows how to use the internal reference of REF module using
//!  the REF control registers. The ADC12_A uses the internal 1.5V reference
//!  and performs a single conversion on channel A0. The conversion results are
//!  stored in ADC12MEM0. Test by applying a voltage to channel A0, then setting
//!  and running to a break point at the "__no_operation()" instruction. To view
//!  the conversion results, open an ADC12_A register window in debugger and view
//!  the contents of ADC12MEM0.
//!
//!                 MSP430F552x

//!
//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - ADC12_A peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//! - A0
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - None.
