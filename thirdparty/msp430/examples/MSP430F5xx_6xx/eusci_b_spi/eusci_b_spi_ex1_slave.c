//*****************************************************************************
//!   SPI slave talks to SPI master using 3-wire mode. Data is received
//!   from master and data from slave is then transmitted back to master.
//!   USCI RX ISR is used to handle communication, CPU normally in LPM4.
//!   Prior to initial data exchange, master pulses slaves RST for complete
//!   reset.
//!
//!   Use with eusci_spi_ex1_master code example.  If the slave is in
//!   debug mode, the reset signal from the master will conflict with slave's
//!   JTAG; to work around, use IAR's "Release JTAG on Go" on slave device.  If
//!   breakpoints are set in slave RX ISR, master must stopped also to avoid
//!   overrunning slave RXBUF.
//!
//!   Tesed on MSP430F67791A

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - SPI peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral (for SPI pins)
//! - UCB0SIMO
//! - UCB0SOMI
//! - UCB0CLK
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - USCI_A0_VECTOR
