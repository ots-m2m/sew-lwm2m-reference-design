//! USCI_A0, SPI 3-Wire Master Incremented Data
//! This example shows how SPI master talks to SPI slave using 3-wire mode.
//! Incrementing data is sent by the master starting at 0x01. Received data is
//! expected to be same as the previous transmission.  eUSCI RX ISR is used to
//! handle communication with the CPU, normally in LPM0. If high, P1.0 indicates
//! valid data reception.  Because all execution after LPM0 is in ISRs,
//! initialization waits for DCO to stabilize against ACLK.
//! ACLK = ~32.768kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = DCO ~ 1048kHz.  BRCLK = SMCLK/2
//!
//! Use with eusci_spi_ex1_slave code example.  If slave is in debug mode, P1.1
//! slave reset signal conflicts with slave's JTAG; to work around, use IAR's
//! "Release JTAG on Go" on slave device.  If breakpoints are set in
//! slave RX ISR, master must stopped also to avoid overrunning slave
//! RXBUF.

//!
//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - SPI peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral (for SPI pins)
//! - UCS peripheral
//! - UCB0SIMO
//! - UCB0SOMI
//! - UCB0CLK
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - USCI_A0_VECTOR
