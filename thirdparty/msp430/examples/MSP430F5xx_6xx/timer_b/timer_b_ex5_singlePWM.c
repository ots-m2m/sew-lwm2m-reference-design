//!  Timer_B, PWM TB0.1, Up Mode, DCO SMCLK
//!
//!  Description: This program generates PWM outputs on P5.7 using
//!  Timer_B configured for up mode. The value , TIMER_PERIOD, defines the PWM
//!  period and the value DUTY_CYCLE the PWM duty cycle. Using ~1.045MHz
//!  SMCLK as TBCLK, the timer period is ~500us with a 75% duty cycle on P5.7
//!  ACLK = n/a, SMCLK = MCLK = TBCLK = default DCO ~1.045MHz.
//!
//!  Tested On: MSP430F5529

//!
//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - Timer peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - NONE
