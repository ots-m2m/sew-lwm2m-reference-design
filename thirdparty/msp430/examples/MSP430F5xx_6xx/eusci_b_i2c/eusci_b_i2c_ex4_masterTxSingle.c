//! This example shows how to configure the I2C module as a master for
//! single byte transmission in interrupt mode. The address of the slave
//! module that the master is communicating with also set in this example.
//!
//!  MSP430F5xx_6xx Demo - USCI_B0 I2C Master TX single bytes to MSP430 Slave
//!
//!  Description: This demo connects two MSP430's via the I2C bus. The master
//!  transmits to the slave. This is the master code. It continuously
//!  transmits 00h, 01h, ..., 0ffh and demonstrates how to implement an I2C
//!  master transmitter sending a single byte using the USCI_B0 TX interrupt.
//!  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = BRCLK = default DCO = ~1.045MHz
//!

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - I2C peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral (for I2C pins)
//! - SCL2
//! - SDA
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - USCI_B0_VECTOR.

//A zero in the "RS" position of the first byte means that the master
//transmits (sends) data to the selected slave, and a one in this position
