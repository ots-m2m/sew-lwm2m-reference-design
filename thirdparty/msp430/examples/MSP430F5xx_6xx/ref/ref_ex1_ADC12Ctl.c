//! REF - ADC12, Using REF Module to control Internal Reference
//!
//!  This example shows how to configure the internal reference of REF module
//!  using the REFCTL0 control register. The ADC12 uses the internal 2.5V
//!  reference and performs a single conversion on channel A0. The conversion
//!  results are stored in ADC12MEM0. Test by applying a voltage to channel A0,
//!  then setting and running to a break point at the "__no_operation()"
//!  instruction. To view the conversion results, open an ADC12 register window
//!  in debugger and view the contents of ADC12MEM0.
//!
//!  NOTE: REFMSTR bit in REFCTL0 regsiter is by default set to 1. This allows
//!  the REFCTL0 control regsiters to configure the reference setting. The
//!  legacy ADC12 reference control bits ADC12REFON, ADC12REF2_5, ADC12TCOFF
//!  and ADC12REFOUT are dont care in this case.
//!
//!           Tested on MSP430F5529

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - REF peripheral
//! - ADC12 peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//! - A0
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - None.
