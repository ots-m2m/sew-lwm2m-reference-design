//! RTC_A in Counter Mode toggles P1.0 every 1s
//!
//!  This program demonstrates RTC in counter mode configured to source from ACLK
//!  to toggle P1.0 LED every 1s.

//!                MSP430F5438A

//!
//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - RTC peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - RTC_A_VECTOR
