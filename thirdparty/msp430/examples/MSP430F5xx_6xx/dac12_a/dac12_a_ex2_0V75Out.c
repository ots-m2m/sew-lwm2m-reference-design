//!  MSP430F6638 Example
//!  Using DAC12_A_1 and 1.5V reference with a gain of 1, output 0.75V on DAC1.
//!  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO

//!
//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - DAC12_A peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//! - DAC1
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - None.
