//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must

//! - DAC12 peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//! - DAC0
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - None.
