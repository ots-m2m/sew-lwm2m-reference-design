//! MPY - 32x32 Signed Multiply
//!
//!  Hardware multiplier is used to multiply two numbers. The calculation is
//!  automatically initiated after the second operand is loaded. Results are
//!  stored in RES0, RES1, RES2 and RES3.
//!
//!  ACLK = 32.768kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
//!
//!  Tested On: MSP430F5438A,MSP430FR5739,MSP430FR5969,MSP430FR2433
