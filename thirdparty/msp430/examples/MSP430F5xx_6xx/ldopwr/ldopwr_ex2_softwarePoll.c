//!   MSP430F530x Demo  - Software Poll PU.0, Set P1.0 if PU.0 = 1

//!  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - LDO-PWR module
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - None.
