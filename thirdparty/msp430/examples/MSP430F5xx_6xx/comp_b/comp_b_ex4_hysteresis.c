//! COMPB - Hysteresis, Output Toggle in LPM4, High Speed Mode
//!
//!  Use CompB and shared reference to determine if input 'Vcompare' is high of
//!  low.  Shared reference is configured to generate hysteresis. When Vcompare
//!  exceeds Vcc*3/4 CBOUT goes high and when Vcompare is less than Vcc*1/4 then
//!  CBOUT goes low. Connect P1.6/CBOUT to P1.0 externally to see the LED toggle
//!  accordingly.

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - COMPB peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//! - CB0
//! - CBOUT
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - None.
