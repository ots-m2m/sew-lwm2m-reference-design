//!   Long word writes to FRAM
//!
//!   Description: Use long word write to write to 512 byte blocks of FRAM.
//!   Toggle LEDs after every 100 writes.
//!   NOTE: Running this example for extended periods will impact the FRAM
//!   endurance.
//!   ACLK = VLO, MCLK = SMCLK = ~1.048MHz
//!
//!   Tested On: MSP430FR4133
