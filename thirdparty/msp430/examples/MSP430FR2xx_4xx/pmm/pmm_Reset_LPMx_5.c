// MSP430FR4133 PMM Test
// This example shows transitions between a user Reset via the reset button, a
// software triggered BOR, a previous LPMx.5 state indicator flag, and entrance
// into LPM4.5. Reading the reset interrupt flag from PMMIFG register is equivalent
// to reading from reset vector register.
//
// Upon device power on you will see the following sequence of LED's
// X = off
// O = on
//
// _0 = On indicates BOR
// _6 = On indicates Reset (from user button)
// _5 = on indicates device was previously in LPMx.5 state before the reset
// _4 = On indicates device is NOT sleeping.  Off means device is in LPM4.5
//*******************************************************************************
//
//  1) Power on device:
//    X0 X6 X5 O4       LED4 is on, device is running and was not in LPM4.5 mode previously.
//
//  2) Press User Reset button:
//
//    X0 O6 X5 O4       Device is running and has reset due to RST pin
//    O0 X6 X5 O4       Device is running and has reset due to a software BOR
//    X0 X6 X5 X4       Device is now in LPM4.5
//
//  3) Press User Reset button:
//    Device will restart the sequence beginning at step 2).
