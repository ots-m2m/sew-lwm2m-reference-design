//! WDT - Toggle P1.0, Interval Overflow ISR, 32kHz ACLK
//!
//!  Toggle P1.0 using software timed by WDT ISR. Toggle rate is exactly 250ms
//!  based on 32kHz ACLK WDT clock source. In this example the WDT is configured
//!  to divide 32768 watch-crystal(2^15) by 2^13 with an ISR triggered
//!  @ 4Hz = [WDT CLK source/32768].
//!  ACLK = REFO , MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO ~1.048MHz
//!
//!  Tested On:    MSP430FR4133

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - WDT peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - WDT_A_VECTOR
