//! WDT - Failsafe Clock, 10KHz VLOCLK
//!
//!  Configure WDT in watchdog to timeout sourced by ACLK. LPM3 is entered. This
//!  example will demonstrate WDT fail-safe feature by automatically selecting
//!  VLOCLK as WDT clock source if ACLK fails. Watchdog timeout will toggle on
//!  P1.0 every 3 seconds in main function.
//!  VLOCLK = 10KHZ, ACLK = 32768, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO ~1.048MHz
//!
//!  Tested On:    MSP430FR4133

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - WDT peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - None.
