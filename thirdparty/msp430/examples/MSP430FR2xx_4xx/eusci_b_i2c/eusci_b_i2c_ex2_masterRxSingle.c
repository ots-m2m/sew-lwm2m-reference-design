//! This example shows how to configure the I2C module as a master for
//! single byte reception in interrupt driven mode. The address of the slave
//! module that the master is communicating with also set in this example.
//!
//!  Description: This demo connects two MSP430's via the I2C bus. The master
//!  reads from the slave. This is the MASTER CODE. The data from the slave
//!  transmitter begins at 0 and increments with each transfer.
//!  The USCI_B0 RX interrupt is used to know when new data has been received.
//!  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = BRCLK =  DCO = ~1MHz
//!

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - I2C peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral (for I2C pins)
//! - SCL2
//! - SDA
//! - CS
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - USCI_B0_VECTOR.
