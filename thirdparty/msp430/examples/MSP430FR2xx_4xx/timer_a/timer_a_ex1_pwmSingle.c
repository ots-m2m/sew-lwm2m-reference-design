//!  Timer_A3, PWM TA1.2, Up Mode, DCO SMCLK
//!
//!  Description: This program generates PWM outputs on P2.2 using
//!  Timer1_A configured for up mode. The value , TIMER_PERIOD, defines the PWM
//!  period and the value DUTY_CYCLE the PWM duty cycle. Using ~1.048MHz
//!  SMCLK as TACLK, the timer period is ~480us with a 75% duty cycle on P4.0
//!  ACLK = n/a, SMCLK = MCLK = TACLK = default DCO ~1.048MHz.
//!
//!  Tested On:   MSP430FR4133

//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - Timer peripheral
//! - GPIO peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - NONE
