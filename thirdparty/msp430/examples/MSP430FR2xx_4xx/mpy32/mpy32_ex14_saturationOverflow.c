//! MPY - Saturation Mode Overflow Test
//!
//!  The example illustrates a special case showing overflow. The addition
//!  result of 2 positive numbers may exceed the highest positive number
//!  (0x7FFF FFFF for 32 bit result) due to overflow indicating a negative
//!  result. By having the saturation mode enabled, this result can be truncated
//!  off to this highest positive number. Results with and without saturation
//!  mode are shown.
//!
//!  ACLK = 32.768kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
//!
//!  Tested On: MSP430F5438A,MSP430FR5739,MSP430FR5969,MSP430FR2433
