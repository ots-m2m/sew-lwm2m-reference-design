<h1><strong>How to use MSP430 DriverLib ROM&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<hr>
<ol>
<strong>Steps to utilize DriverLib in ROM from a user
application</strong><br>
<li>Please locate rom_driverlib.h. A copy can be found inside
driverlib/{FAMILY}</li>
<br>
<li><em>Optional but recommended step:</em> Please
locate rom_map_driverlib.h. A copy can be found inside
driverlib/{FAMILY}
</li>
<br>
<li>Please locate rom_headers/ directory. A copy can be found
inside driverlib/{FAMILY}</li>
<br>
<li>By default, the rom_driverlib.h you use must be at same
directory level as rom_headers/</li>
<br>
<li>#include "{PATH}/rom_driverlib.h"</li>
<ul>
<li>rom_driverlib.h will automatically map you to the ROM
header for the
device you are using inside rom_headers/.
</li>
<li>This defines ROM_ functions, and allows them for use.
</li>
<li>Using ROM_ functions provide memory space savings for
your application.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>#include "{PATH}/rom_map_driverlib.h"</li>
<ul>
<li>This step is technically optional, but highly
recommended. Without this file, MAP_ functions will not be available.
</li>
<li>Using MAP_{API_NAME} will use ROM_{API_NAME} when
possible, and {API_NAME} from a linked source file/library out of
FLASH/FRAM when not.
</li>
<li>This will create a seamless functional experience for the
user application.
</li>
<li>You may use ROM_ functions directly to force a call into
ROM for the function, but not every DriverLib API has a ROM equivalent.
</li>
<li>MAP_ functions provide all the benefits of ROM_ functions
while abstracting the need to know which specific ROM_ functions exist.
</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<strong>Details about MSP430 DriverLib ROM feature</strong>
<li>Not every device has MSP430 DriverLib in ROM. Please
consult device's datasheet to see if it is available.</li>
<br>
<li>Not every device's ROM holds the same subset of DriverLib.</li>
<br>
<li>DriverLib in ROM is tested to work with both CCS and IAR
compilers.
</li>
<ul>
<li>Because the calling conventions between the two compilers
are slightly different, the ROM image must adhere to a certain <strong><em>__cc_rom</em></strong>
convention that
both compilers can agree upon. As such, there are certain limitations
on a user application using ROM.
<ul>
<li>#include "rom_driverlib.h" will continue to throw
helpful hints at build time until the user application adheres to <strong><em>__cc_rom</em></strong>
</li>
<li>For more information, please consult the MSP430 IAR
or
CCS compiler User's Guide on the <strong><em>__cc_rom</em></strong>
calling convention.
</li>
<li>For example, IAR has options to reserve R4/R5 for
global variables. CCS has no such option. Therefore on common ground,
an IAR user
application must declare R4/R5 to be free and not reserved in order to
utilize ROM.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>There may also be certain limitations to user application
based off device-specific ROM designs.
<ul>
<li>For example, if the DriverLib ROM image lives above 64k
memory addresses, it would make sense that the user application must be
large code model (20-bit address pointer rather than 16-bit).
